# Hotel-Management-CPP-OOPS

Welcome to the Hotel Management System project! This C++ project is designed to help manage hotel records efficiently. 
It employs Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and provides a range of functionalities for easy management of hotel data. 
I have used two text files, one for storing customer records and the other for the password of the hotel management system.

## Features
Enter New Record: This feature allows you to add new guest records to the system. You can input details such as guest name, room number, mobile number, and more.

Display Old Records: View previously recorded guest information. This helps in keeping track of past guests and their stays.

Modify Records: Update guest information when needed. Whether it's a change in contact information or other details, this feature simplifies record management.

Search Records: Quickly locate guest records based on room number.

Delete Records: Remove outdated or unnecessary guest records from the system to maintain a clean and organized database.

Exit the System: Safely exit the program when you've completed your tasks.
